Dears, welcome to Mr.X!!!

Mr.X is a Python script to explore surface vulnerabilities from a host. All versions will be available sporadically. 
The goal here is provide a complete program that can found all surficial vulnerabilities such as open ports, doxed services, banners and probable authentications with a real time feedback.
As we know, the script will take a several time to be executed, but will provide some reports to file evidences to a customer that hires a pentest service.

Ps: Only the found ones will be reported to the created doc.

NOTE: This is for study and assist you in a job. Issues regarding violation and anything that goes against a law are not my responsability.

VERSIONS:

1.0 - DNS Resolver, Port Scan and Banner Grabbing.
1.1 (Under Construction) - 1.0 + time started grabbing, time exexecuted grabbing and HTML-Dox catching
1.2 - 1.1 + socket report
